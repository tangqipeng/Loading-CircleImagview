Simple progress with ImageView android

  <img src="etc/demo.gif" alt="progress image view" />
</p>

## Install 
Add the dependecy

```gradle
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
dependencies {
  compile 'com.github.safetysystemtechnology:progress-image-view-android:v1.0'
}
 Â 
```


### Add permissions in your androidmanifest.xml
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

## Usage

```xml
<safety.com.br.progressimageview.ProgressImageView
        android:layout_width="120dp"
        android:layout_height="120dp"
        android:id="@+id/progress_image_view" />

```

```java

private ProgressImageView progressImageView;

progressImageView = (ProgressImageView) findViewById(R.id.progress_image_view);

//Start animation of loading
progressImageView.showLoading();

```
By default the animation of progress is auto hide.
if you prefer, you can set auto hide `false`
```java
progressImageView.showLoading().withAutoHide(false);
```
but to stop the animation you should invoke method `hideLoading`
```java
 progressImageView.hideLoading();
```

You can set the animation color and set the border size of animation
```java
progressImageView.withBorderColor(Color.RED).withBorderSize(10);
```
and set custom offSet 
```java
progressImageView.withOffset(10);
```
